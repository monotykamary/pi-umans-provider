# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Quiet startup sync: background `/v1/models/info` revalidation runs only with an API key, only when the disk cache is older than 1 hour (`PI_PROVIDER_SYNC_TTL_MS`, `0` = always), missing, or fetched with a different key, and only in one pi process at a time (lock file next to the cache). Failed refreshes back off for 5 minutes; sessions that skip adopt a cache refreshed by another process. `/login` forces a revalidation with the new key.
- Never store the API key: key changes are detected via a salted sha256 fingerprint in `cache/umans-models.sync.json`. The cache file format is unchanged.
- Usage footer: `/v1/usage` is no longer called without a UI (print mode, headless child agents). The session-start usage fetch is shared across pi processes for 60 seconds via `cache/umans-usage.json`; turn-end and idle polling are unchanged.
- Write the model cache atomically and swallow API key resolution failures in `session_start`.
- Add vitest coverage for the sync policy and the session_start integration.

## 1.0.32

- Validate provider registration and session lifecycle against Pi 1.0.0; update the pinned development SDK.

## 1.0.31

- Test against Pi 0.99.0 and declare host-provided modules as wildcard peers.
- Replace no-op checks with scoped TypeScript checks and an offline real-Pi loader, provider-registration, and session-lifecycle smoke test.
